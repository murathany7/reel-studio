## Motion

```json
{"frames_compared": 833, "moving_frames": 500, "static_frames": 333, "median_pct_pixels_changed_when_moving": 0.911, "hitches": [], "jumps": []}
```

- **Hitches** (a duplicate frame during motion) cause visible stutter. Fix the timeline at those times.
- **Jumps** are frames that change much more than their neighbours. Fine if it's an intended hard cut; otherwise add easing or a transition. Evidence is in `flagged/`.
- Frozen sections (≥1.5 s): freeze_start: 0.5 freeze_duration: 1.6 freeze_start: 9.78333 freeze_duration: 1.51667
- Black sections: none

## Visual review

- `contact_sheet_safezones.jpg`: every 0.5 s (left→right, top→bottom; tile k = k×0.5 s) with paid-Reels unsafe areas in red. No text, logo, mascot or CTA may sit in red.
- Then review the key beats frame by frame (`render.mjs stills --at …`) and listen once with sound.
